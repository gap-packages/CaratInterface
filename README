The GAP 4 share package "Interface to Carat" provides GAP interface 
routines to some of the stand-alone programs in the package Carat, 
developed by J. Opgenorth, W. Plesken, and T. Schulz at Lehrstuhl B 
f\"ur Mathematik, RWTH Aachen. Carat is a package for the computation 
with crystallographic groups. It is implemented in C, and thus
needs to be compiled. It runs on Unix systems only.

Carat is to a large extent complementary to the GAP share package
CrystGap. In particular, it provides routines for the computation 
of normalizers and conjugators of finite unimodular groups in GL(n,Z),
and routines for the computation of Bravais groups, which are all 
missing in CrystGap.  Furthermore, it provides also a catalogue of 
Bravais groups up to dimension 6. CrystGap automatically loads Carat
when it is available, and makes use of its functions where necessary. 
This share package thereby extends the functionality of CrystGap 
considerably.

Please note that Carat itself is NOT part of the share package.  
All rights and responsibilities regarding Carat remain with its
authors. However, for your convenience, and with the permission of the
Carat authors, a copy of Carat is included in the package. It is this
version with which the interface routines have been tested. The most
recent version of Carat can be obtained at

    http://wwwb.math.rwth-aachen.de/carat/
 
The GAP interface routines to Carat have been written by

    Franz G\"ahler

    Universit\"at Stuttgart, Pfaffenwaldring 57

    gaehler@itap.physik.uni-stuttgart.de

to whom bug reports regarding these interface routines should be
addressed. Bug reports regarding Carat itself should be sent to

    carat@momo.math.rwth-aachen.de.

This package must be installed in the pkg subdirectory of any of
the GAP 4 root directories. We assume here that this is /gap4/pkg.

    cd /gap4/pkg
    unzoo -x carat.zoo

This creates a subdirectory carat, the home directory of the share
package. Carat itself can be installed anywhere on your system. 
You only have to make sure GAP finds the Carat binaries, by making 
a symbolic link from the bin subdirectory in the home directory
of the carat share package to the bin subdirectory of Carat itself. 
In our example, we install Carat in /gap4/pkg/carat (the Carat tar 
file should already be there):

    cd /gap4/pkg/carat
    zcat carat.1.2.tar.gz | tar xf -
    ln -s carat/bin bin
    cd carat

This creates a subdirectory /gap4/pkg/carat/carat, the CARAT top level
directory. You have to edit the Makefile in that directory. In particular,
you have to set the variables TOPDIR (to /gap4/pkg/carat/carat), CC, and
CFLAGS (to your favourite set of compiler options). Then do 

    make

If you build for more than one architecture, make sure to do a 
'make clean' in between.

Like any other share package, Carat is then loaded in GAP with

    RequirePackage("carat");

This share package, together with Carat, takes some 60Mb of disk space,
or more, depending on the system. Some 33Mb is taken by the catalog
of Q-classes if integer matrix groups up to dimension 6. If you want
to avoid unpacking this catalog, you can create empty subdirectories

    cd /gap4/pkg/carat/carat
    mkdir tables
    mkdir tables/qcatalog

before making Carat. If you want to unpack the catalog later, just
remove the empty directory tables/qcatalog, and do

    make Qcatalog
