This share package contains GAP 4 interface routines to Carat, 
a package of programs for the computation with crystallographic
groups. Carat is implemented in C, and has been developed at Lehrstuhl
B f"ur Mathematik, RWTH Aachen. Carat itself is NOT part of this share
package. Carat can be obtained at

    http://samuel.math.rwth-aachen.de/~LBFM/carat/
 
The GAP interface routines to Carat have been written by

    Franz G"ahler
    Institut f"ur Theoretische und Angewandte Physik 
    Universit"at Stuttgart, Pfaffenwaldring 57
    D-70550 Stuttgart

    gaehler@itap.physik.uni-stuttgart.de

to whom bug reports regarding these interface routines should be
addressed. Bug reports regarding Carat itself should be sent to

    carat@momo.math.rwth-aachen.de.

The interface routines in this package fall into two parts: low level
interface routines which deal with the data files of Carat programs,
and implementations (using Carat) of methods for higher level
functions declared in the GAP library. 

This package must be installed in one of the GAP 4 root directories.
It is loaded with

    RequirePackage( "carat" );

For each type of hardware (see the GAP 4 bin directory), the 
pkg/carat/bin directory must contain a link to the corresponding 
directory with the Carat binaries, or a directory containing the
Carat binaries.

Files:

    gap/carat.gd:     declarations of low level Carat interface routines
    gap/carat.gi:     implementations of low level Carat interface routines
    gap/methods.gi:   methods (using Carat) for higher level
                      functions declared in the GAP library 

    The contents of the following file might eventually be moved to the 
    GAP library:

    gap/util.gi:      Stabilizer for groups without membership test
