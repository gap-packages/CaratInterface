This share package contains GAP 4 interface routines to Carat, 
a package of programs for the computation with crystallographic
groups. Carat is implemented in C, and has been developed by
J.~Opgenorth, W.~Plesken, and T.~Schulz at Lehrstuhl~B f\accent127ur 
Mathematik, RWTH Aachen. Carat itself is NOT part of this share 
package. However, for your convenience, and with the permission
of the Carat authors, a copy of Carat is included in this package. 
It is this version with which the interface routines have been
tested. The most recent version of Carat can be obtained at
