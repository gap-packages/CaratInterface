\Chapter{Installation}

{\GAP} is distributed together with a large number of packages, including
this one. {\Carat} is located inside the subdirectory `pkg/carat/' of your 
{\GAP} installation, and needs to be compiled. If you do not want to build 
all packages with the script `BuildPackages.sh' from {\GAP}, you can build 
{\Carat} alone by executing these commands inside the directory `pkg/carat/':

\begintt
./configure <path to GAP root>
make
\endtt

The configure script optionally takes the path to the root directory of 
your {\GAP} installation as argument. The default `../..' should usually 
work, but if you have unpacked {\Carat} to a location like `~/.gap/pkg/carat/', 
you need to explicitly give the path to the {\GAP} root directory as argument.

As {\CARAT}'s catalog of Q-classes of unimodular groups is rather large,
it is unpacked by default only up to dimension~5. If you also want
to unpack the data for dimension~6, you can do this with the extra
command (again inside directory `pkg/carat/')

\begintt
make qcat6
\endtt

This adds another 150 Mb of data to the installation.
